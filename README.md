# Student-Grading-System
The Student Grading  System is a C++ project that generates random data for 50 students, including roll numbers, midterm, final, and class marks. It assigns grades based on final marks using a standard scheme and displays records with sorting options by roll number or marks, providing a comprehensive academic performance overview.
